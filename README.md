# Password Manager

A personal desktop password manager I made years ago (2002) and just recently
(2017) upgraded to use AES-256 instead of RC4. It's still working; I use it
every day, and it works on Windows, OSX, and Ubuntu!

The encrypted passwords.txt file generated by this app may be synced with
a file hosting service like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.
